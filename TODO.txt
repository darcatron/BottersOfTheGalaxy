- Do some winning strategy
  Potential Strat
     UPDATES:
     1) Buy items with gold
     2) Avoid their tower and just go for their hero?
     3) When finding minions to attack, we should pick the one in range with the lowest health! Not just the closest one
     4) Improve logic that determines when we should attack enemy hero
     5) Improve what items we buy and when
            - maybe wait later to get more gold to buy better stuff rather than buy everything ASAP
     6) Experiment with other heroes
