- Do some winning strategy
  Potential Strat
     UPDATES:
     1) When finding minions to attack, we should pick the one in range with the lowest health! Not just the closest one
     2) Improve logic that determines when we should attack enemy hero
     3) Improve what items we buy and when
            - build gold from last hits to buy best items when behind a shield minion
     4) Avoid being in range of enemy hero's attack when they have more minions
     5) Stand further behind shield minion to avoid hits from enemy minion while staying in range for our hero to attack minion
     6) Use our attackRange to move only as close as we to before attacking.
        e.g we're at posX = 50 and enemy is at posX = 100. If our range is 30, we should move it posX = 70, not posX = 100 (which we do now)
     7) Use last hits (MATUSH)
     8) Experiment with other heroes
