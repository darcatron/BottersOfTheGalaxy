- Do some winning strategy
  Potential Strat
     UPDATES:
     1) Buy items with gold
     2) Avoid their tower and just go for their hero?
     3) Attack plan
        If tower:
            attack tower
        Else if (isEnemyHeroNear && our minions > their minions):
            attack hero
        Else if (areEnemyMinionsNear):
            attack minions -----> We should pick the one in range with the lowest health! Not just the closest one
     4) Improve what items we buy and when
            - maybe wait later to get more gold to buy better stuff rather than buy everything ASAP
     5) Experiment with other heroes
